## What it isn't

- Scouter is not a translation tool. Its goal is to help you learn to use foreign languages independently.
- Scouter is not a conversation tool. It only supports one-time quiz answering based on the questions provided by AI.

## Why develop Scouter?

I've been studying English since before ChatGPT was available, and I prefer to learn in real language environments, such as reading articles and participating in English community discussions. However, I had been unable to find a tool that could analyze and explain the grammar of target sentences until I encountered ChatGPT. Although ChatGPT can help me analyze and practice grammar, I still need to manually copy and paste sentences and switch to the ChatGPT window to ask questions each time.
